# Goalie-Stats-App
A goalie stats tracker app specifically made for hockey goalies that makes it easy to track and record game stats. Built in Android Studio
and utilizes MySQLite for the backend database

Note: 3/20/17
- Currently working is the stats tracker main activity, the add new user activity, and the user list activity
- This app is not completed. Currently working on saving actual stats and little design flaws. I will provide a download link once completed.

Note: 1/21/18 - Goalie Stats App 1.0 Alpha
- The app is now in its alpha stage and can be used to save stats
- There is a new navigation splash page to allow the user a more free navigation of the app instead of the previous linear navigation
- This is a minimum build and is still missing some functionality such as:
    - Saving stats on a game-by-game basis
    - Design flaws
    - Allow user to upload images
    - Implement Recycler View on Users list
    - Finish fragmentation for quicker navigation through each activity
