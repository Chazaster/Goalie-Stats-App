# Goalie-Stats-App
A goalie stats tracker app specifically made for hockey goalies that makes it easy to track and record game stats. Built in Android Studio
and utilizes MySQLite for the backend database

Note: 6/23/17
- Currently working is the stats tracker main activity, the add new user activity, and the user list activity
- UserStats activity partially working: data from main activity successfully transfers to specified user across 2 activities
- This app is not completed. Currently working on saving actual stats and little design flaws. I will provide a download link once completed.
- User can now delete users in database within UserStats activity
